# Help Me Code 
### A resource to help me write code
##### By: Tyler Taormina

### Summary
This is some software that is currently being written for myself. I am writing 
it on an Apple Silicon Mac using the C programming language. The goal is to 
provide myself the ability to enter 'help-me-code' on the command line and to 
be presented with a menu displaying different categories. These categories will
be aimed at simplifying the process of finding example code that I have previously
written as it relates to the problem I need help with. For example, one category
will be 'Algorithms' in which programs are seperated based on the algorithms 
they use. This program will be run as a daemon and use a server that provides
the needed program information. The main reason for writing this is to get 
more comfortable doing some simple network programming as well as getting 
practice with daemons on OSX. I will likely move this over to linux as well once
the program is functional. 

### Example Usage

### Category Ideas
- Algorithms
- Networking
- Binary Trees
- Linked Lists
- Programming Languages

### Information for each program (tentative)
- Path to program
- Line number of desired example
- opens neovim in desired file

### Notes:
